# client_id-webscrape
This is a Python script I wrote to scrape customer IDs from a propietary software at my previous company. We scraped the IDs to use them in a web API built by our developers. We downloaded CSV files of all performance data from each client using an HTTP GET request. Then, we used the data to gather insights into how we can help increase sales on ecommerce sites.
